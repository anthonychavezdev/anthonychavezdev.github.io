  My name is Anthony, I am a 27 year old Software Engineer working for Discover Financial Services.
  I love computers, programming, rock climbing, anime, astronomy, math, and science!
  I go hiking a few times a year with friends, I'm learning guitar, and I enjoy tinkering with unique technologies.
  I like messing around with:
  - Emacs
  - Common Lisp
  - Ocaml
  - Nix and NixOS
