  My name is Anthony, I am a 23 year old college graduate with a bachelors in Computer Science.
  I loves computers, programming, rock climbing, anime, and astronomy.
  I think it's all interesting. I created this site to practice web development, store information on
  various projects, information, as well as to have a place to point any future employers to.
  Here you can find information about me like interests, projects, and information on how to contact
