   <summary>bfjit</summary>
   <p>
   I wrote a JIT compiler for the bf programming language.
   It takes in a program as input, generates CPU instructions on the fly,
   and executes them, giving a big speed boost when compared to the interpreter.

     <summary>Chip8</summary>
     <p>
     I wrote a Chip 8 emulator in C that
     can play Chip 8 ROMS, draw graphics to
     the screen, and read keyboard input.
     The only feature it's lacking, is sound.

     <summary>Nextcloud instance</summary>
     <p>
     A Google Drive like program that I set
     up at home to sync my documents, pictues,
     contacts, and anything else I might want
     to sync with it. I have full control
     over it.

     <summary>Remotely Controlled Car</summary>
     <p>
     A car I built using parts from the GopiGo
     project. It can be controlled via a
     bluetooth controller and can stream
     video as well, through a local web server
     running on it.

     <summary>Grab Some Cake</summary>

     A very simple game where you have to
     platform your way through simple levels
     to grab a slice of cake.

     <summary>Original Personal Site</summary>
     <p>
     I made a personal site for myself which
     contains links to my project, a blog that
     I had started but discontinued, and
     information on the tools I use on a
     daily basis.
